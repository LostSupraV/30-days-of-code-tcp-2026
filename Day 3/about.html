                    Hello! I'm Rishi, an undergraduate student specializing in Electronics and Communication Engineering
                    at NIT Raipur. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in both theoretical and
                    practical aspects of electronics, communication systems, and software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a keen interest in exploring new technologies and enhancing my problem-solving skills through
                    hands-on projects. My passion for learning drives me to stay updated with the latest advancements in
                    the tech world, and I am always eager to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond academics, I am disciplined, curious, and committed to continuous self-improvement. My goal
                    is to build a robust skill set that combines electronics and programming, preparing me for future
                    opportunities in both industry and research.
                </p>
